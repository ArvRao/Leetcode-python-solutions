Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

 

Example 1:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
Example 3:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
Example 4:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KNN","KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
Example 5:

Input: list1 = ["KFC"], list2 = ["KFC"]
Output: ["KFC"]
