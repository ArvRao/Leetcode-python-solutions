The starting and destination cities are appeared only once.

Given a list of lists containing starting and ending cities, we need to find the destination city.
First item is starting and second item means the ending city. The destination city has no starting item.

class Solution:
    def destCity(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        
        end = set([path[1] for path in paths])
        start = set([path[0] for path in paths])
        destination = end - start
        return list(destination)[0]

print(destCity([["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]))      # returns A

end-start removes all overalpping cities and only has destination city. Convert it back to list to access element.
