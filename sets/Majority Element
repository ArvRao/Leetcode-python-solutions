Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s=list(set(nums))
        l=len(nums)/2
        for i in s:
            if nums.count(i)>l: # 
                return i

sets only contains unique elements.
i has unique elements while the ones in nums are actual list.
