We need to check in a given sentence(string) whether all the letters are present.
Use of sets or dictionary is optimal since it contains unique letters.
If length of sentence is 26, it means all letters are present

class Solution(object):
    def checkIfPangram(self, s):
        return len(set(s)) == 26


def checkIfPangram(self, s):
        d={}
        for i in s:
            d[i]=i
        if len(d)==26:
            return True
        return False
