Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
 

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Solution:
First, convert the given binary strings into base 10 integers. Then add them.
Finally, return the binary value of the answer.

def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
# Convert the given strings to int and add them. Then return bin value of result.
        return bin(int(a,2)+int(b,2))[2:]
		
		
		# [2:] is taken because python returns the bin value starting with "0b" which we do not need.
