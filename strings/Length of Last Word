Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: s = " "
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.

Convert the given string into list so as to obtain the last word.
Later return the len of the last item of the list.

        s = s.split()
        if len(s) == 0:
            return 0
       
        return len(s[-1])
